# Researchr

This is my personal fork of [Stian
HÃ¥klev](http://reganmian.net/blog/about-me/)'s ingenious tool and script
collection called *researchr*. 

## What's researchr

*researchr* realizes an easy to use scientific workflow for Mac OS X plattforms
using mainly [Chrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) [Skim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skim_(software)), [BibDesk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibdesk), [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) and [DokuWiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DokuWiki), "glued" 
together by a ton of Ruby skripts making up an easy to use workflow for
researching and acquiring literature, reading them, processing the information
and develop own ideas based on what you read, as well as store it for later
uses. There's a detailed description on [Stians
Wiki](http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start) and some live demos,
e.g. [this one](http://youtu.be/k8uybWYbiL8), to give you an impression of the power of *researchr*. I've also
written a [blog
entry](http://pygospasprofession.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/computer-aided-scientific-workflow/#more-4543) on it.

## Goals of this fork

After getting everything set up, I'd like to contribute. Most importantly I
would like to keep this workflow as open source and cross plattform as possible
(I deem this difficult for Skim and BibDesk (thoug BibDesk could maybe be
replaced by [JabRef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JabRef))). Especially, tools like [Taskpaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper) or [Scrivener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrivener_(software)) can be
replaced by Markup files and an Editor such as vim. Instead of producing
Scrivener-created Word- or RTF-Documents, directly editable LaTeX would be nice.
And instead of using Chrome many people rather use
[Firefox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) (including
myself)

In my opinion this might help making *researchr* availiable to more people. At
least it would suite my purposes better.

## Thanks

Please all credit Stian for his ingenious idea of inventing this workflow,
which he has been doing for three years now (without even having CS as his
field of studies!). It's really great work!
